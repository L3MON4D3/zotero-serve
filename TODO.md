# Handle attachment's fields?
One example is itemID 559, it is an attachment that does not represent a local
file.
## Q: 
* How to show this data? Since attachments are also listed in the
  collection-overview, their fields should also be shown. But I suspect that
  wouldn't look good at all..
  So we'd probably need a separate page for attachments, and I don't like that
  the most common path (choose collection -> choose item -> download file) would
  need one more click (choose collection -> choose item -> choose attachment ->
  download file).
